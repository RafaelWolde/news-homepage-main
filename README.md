### What I learned

I learned a lot about code organization but still need a lot of work to craft my ability to easily and consistently use methodologies that help me write a readable css code. I tried to use BEM naming system but fall short in identifying what I should consider to be a A block and find it hard naming blocks within a block and blocks that could be considered elements.

### Continued development

I still want to improve my CSS and HTML to a industry level.

### Useful resources

Css-tricks is a fun way to learn css and There are useful channels on youtube I recommended in my last project
